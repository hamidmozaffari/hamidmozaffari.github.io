I'm a Ph.D. candidate at UMass Amherst in the [College of Information and Computer Science] under the supervision of [Amir Houmansadr]. My research focus is in security, privacy, and fairness of machine learning algorithms. I received my M.Sc degree from [Amirkabir University of Technology] under supervision of [Babak Sadeghiyan], where I designed a congestion control for [Tor] to mitigate DoS attacks as my thesis.
